          <p style="display:inline;"> The differences are simple, but numerous. A public college received funding from our government. Allowing them the abiliity to provide cheaper tuition fees and received more students. In comparison, you will realized private school such as Stanford are extremely expensive. The fees are are the chart! They don't receive income from the government; thus, relies heavily on donations plus community contribution. Their schools are small and specific. Each class receive plenty of teacher-to-student focus. Even the class teaching are focused. Private schools don't offer too many majors, but the ones they do offer are in-depth and specialized in comparison to public school's vague majors. The choice is your: to be publicor to be private. Know this, have money.</p>

          <p style="display:inline;"> The majority of students yearned to enroll into a four years university. They are the high achievers, diving straight into the hard courses. But we don't have to rapid fire our lives. At community colleges, we can stroll through our two years. Not only are the courses cheaper, but almost anyone can be enrolled. Here, we can breeze through our classes. What make community colleges  a tasty meal is its opportunity. There, you had time to explore your major and knock off expensive courses cheaply. The less time we spent in four year univerity, the less amount of money wasted. Analogically, community colleges is a great stepping stone to university and provide very, very, very flexible schedule creation. Even if your end goal required university, don't list out community. Even if you don't plan to continue your education, community is cheap and a worthwhile investment of time and resources. The path you take is solely your. Choose wisely.</p>
