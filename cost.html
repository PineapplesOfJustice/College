          <p style="text-shadow:1px 1px 4px #009900; font-size:27px;">The Prices of the Top 3:</p>   
         <ul>
             <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">University of California: Los Angeles</span> = <span style="color:yellow;">$13,749</span> tuitions and fees. Not including supplies, boarding, transportation, and dining.</li>
             <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Cal Poly Pomona</span> = <span style="color:#16C576;">$7,297</span> tuitions and fees. Not including supplies, boarding, transportation, and dining.</li>
             <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Stanford</span> = <span style="color:#FE5D19;">$49,617</span> tuitions and fees. Not including supplies, boarding, transportation, and dining.</li>

          <p style="text-shadow:1px 1px 4px #009900; font-size:27px;">Out-State / In-State Disaster:</p>   
            <p>As residents of California, it is not a bad decision to remain in-state for colleges. We have a wide selection, but that isn't our main concerns. With the exceptions of private schools, students will notice huge price inflation when learning out-state. Have Cal Poly as an example. Originally just $7,297, it reached the staggering price of $19,177 for students outside of California. Take an already expensive school and the price will be tremendous. That aside, the price doesn't matter as long as the school you want is the school you want.</p>

          <p style="text-shadow:1px 1px 4px #009900; font-size:27px;">Community & Four Years:</p>   
          <p>My recommendation for a cheap school will always be PCC. Why? It is a community college. Quick, easy, and dirt-cheap. In fact, by going through a community college, we can knock off what could be expensive university courses! The reason why most students won't give community college a single glance is due to the extra time they need to spend on education or simply had already gather enough scholarship to fund their way. As I always say, every individual's course is unique.</p>

          <p style="text-shadow:1px 1px 4px #009900; font-size:27px;">On the Matter of Public & Privacy:</p>   
            <p>Any government-funded school is considered public and private is just the inverse. Public school will always be cheaper, tuitions wise. But often, private school provide just enough scholarships to support your entire year. It is an interesting debate. Private school or public school. Honestly, it relies partly on the amount of scholarships received and on what major we want. After all, we won't want to enter another university, even if it is cheaper, unless there is something to be gained in the process. Our choice.</p>
            <br>
          <p style="text-shadow:1px 1px 4px #009900; font-size:27px;">Payment Options:</p>   
            <p>First thing of college, learn how to save money. As everyone said, "A penny saved, is a penny earned." Never waste money. To pay for college, you will need plenty of scholarship, or not, plenty of support from the family, get a job, and possibly still need student loans. College = money. Don't enrolled unless you are certain your wallet is fat enough. Thankfully, there are alway other options. One, join the military. They provide free education, lifetime benefits, pay you, just for staying their four years. Second, enroll in a community college. It is cheap enough to work and learn. Plus, you can earn scholarships and courses credits, if you decided university will come eventually. Third, study hard for high school, join extracurricular activities, and promote your worth. Someone might just take you by the silver spoon. College is worth it, but the first few years will be struggles against the accumulating debts.</p>
