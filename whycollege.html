           <p>Looking at this bar graph, I can say with utmost confidence that higher college degrees earn you you bigger bucks. Assuming one is not blind, merely skimming the data will provide all essential informations. La pregunta numera una, would you rather earn $52,200 or $30,400 a year? Not surprisingly most go for the bachelor degree. How about $62,300 vs. $52,200? Again, the higher number, though this time, the journey will be much harder. After all, we are aiming for a master degree. However, there is more to degrees than just numbers, it is what career we want that choose our need.</p>

           <p>It is a funny thing. If we only stare at this circle graph, we can merrily convince ourselves college is completely unnecessary. After all, why would anyone want to strive for a degree when there are plenty of jobs needing only a high school diploma? 63%. It is the major percentage. We can be labor. We can be cook. We can be a programmer. But I assure you, a basic high school diploma won't get you hired for the specialized career you may want. Unless, you are ultra talented, which I admit, even I am not. Thus, it is safer to assume a degree will benefit, job selection wise. A doctor. A dentist. A super programmer. We will need a degree for those. Possibly, even a doctorate. Putting it simply, does the career you want required specialized experiences and learnings? If no, go right to work. If yes, chew on the possibly...</p>

          <p>Now, the question we have all been waiting for..... How long can we live? Surpisingly, or not surprising, higher education led to a longer average life expectancy. For 2012, the difference was only 3 years, but between now and then, the gap can will widen. Face it, with the human population annually rising, competition will only follow. Large company will only hired the fancy professionals with their fancy doctorate. Then where will we be? Sitting in a dumpster, waiting for donations. When given the choice, company select only the ones most likely to benefit them. With virtually no money, we will starve, or simply don't have the ability to afford expensive medical attentions to extend our lives. That aside, this graph really intrigue me. In all four scenario, women were recorded to live longer than men. Strange..... but not related to our topic!</p>

          <p>You heard me rambing about the statistic enough time by now. Say, read this pictogram yourselves won't you? I will be very pleased. Deal? Deal. Alright, we learned enough of how college give more job opportunity and higher salary, let's be cons college for the sake of argueing. Despite all talk of how college provide the higher salary, it must be taken into account that not everyone is capable of reaching college level of education. It is hard, time consuming, and challenging. Morever, not everyone ride their four years on a silver ship of scholarship. These students can drown in student loans. Why, they will come out extremely economically insecure. Put in a worse situation than when they came in. Their families work hard to funds these hopes, it is a huge burden; yet, it can indeed be argue that these struggles create citizens more life hardened than any others. I can only say, plan your decision wisely.</p>

          <p>Military, definitely an option I never considered. With an acceptance rate of 29% and competition with colleges, I simply want to point out its benefits, which it seem to have in abundance. By enlisting in the military, you will be undergoing a harsh training regime. You will be injured, you will cry, you will wish you were dead. But let's not dwaddle, if enlisted, you will be granted the power of veteran coupons. Essentially, all major and minor store in the U.S. will grant you some sort of discounts. In fact, you get paid while staying in the military, which is more than most college students can dream of. You can even attend military college and learn the career you want for free, albeit, you must continue with the military for four years. Honestly, for four years of torture, you are set to the boot for the rest of your life. Why, you can leap and run marathons just as well as any other athletes, if not better. Remember, veterans alway get special treatments. That is it really, a will of steel is your sole support in the military. Train your pain threshold and rise above every others. Go team, maximum efforts!</p>
